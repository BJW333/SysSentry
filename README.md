# SysSentry
SysSentry is a cross‑platform, Python‑based system monitoring and network sniffing tool. It provides real‑time insights into CPU, memory, disk, and network usage, while also scanning running processes for suspicious activity. A built‑in packet sniffer (using Scapy) captures network traffic and displays protocol details in a user‑friendly GUI.
